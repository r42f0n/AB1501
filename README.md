Proposal and Marketing PlanThe Proposal assignment requires your team (of 4-5 students) to come up with a short proposal for a viable businessidea. Your team is to hand in the softcopy and hardcopy of the Slide Deck Report for your proposal before the startof your tutorial session. Your team is to do an Oral Presentation on your proposal slide deck report. As the oralpresentation is assessed on an individual basis, all team members must present for this presentation.Based on the feedback received for your proposal, your team is to come up with a full marketing plan. Your team isto hand in the softcopy and hardcopy of the Slide Deck Report for your proposal before the start of your tutorialsession during Teaching Week 11. Your team is to do an Oral Presentation on your marketing plan slide deck report.As the oral presentation is assessed on an individual basis, all team members must present for this presentation.Please be prepared to respond to questions which may include marketing concepts.





You will need to declare the use of generative AI or tools for your final submission of the slide deck report by makingappropriate citations and references. Refer to following link for an example of how to cite for the use of generativeAI. Please include the declaration for generative AI (see NTULearn for the declaration template) as part of yoursubmission.As the proposal slide deck report content and the marketing plan slide deck report content are based on a teameffort, all members of your team will get the same marks for the content of these assignments. You should bringany concerns about any of the team member(s) (e.g., lack of effort) to the attention of your respective tutor duringthe preparation period, so these concerns can be addressed. Peer evaluation will be conducted for both teamprojects via Eureka. See Annex A for the relevant rubric for peer evaluation. If any team member scores an averagerating of 6 and below (i.e., the mean of the ratings from all other team members) for the criteria of Contribution,your tutor will engage directly all the team members about the issue(s) at hand. If your tutor deems that a teammember has not contributed sufficiently after looking into the matter, a penalty will be dealt to the offending teammember. The course coordinator will also be consulted on this matter before any penalty is finalised. This processis to ensure that no student is unfairly accused of not contributing to the team projects without clear supportingevidence.Moreover, the peer evaluation results for both the proposal assignment and the marketing plan assignment will bereleased to your peers to give them quantitative feedback and qualitative feedback (i.e., what they have done well,what can be improved upon). Teamwork is essential skill set for students to learn.Please make sure that you keep any negative comments civil. Even though you should raise any concerns that youmight have about your team members, that does not mean you can use inappropriate language and be offensive ingeneral.Reflection JournalFor your own Reflection Journal, you are expected to critically reflect on your planning (including the proposalpresentation). Most of you are doing such a project for the first time and this assignment will be helpful for you tounderstand how you can improve on working effectively on future tasks in a team-based setting. This assignment issplit into two parts.The first step is an ungraded submission for your tutor’s reference.

The instructorwill provide feedback directly during such class and in-class team discussion. The instructors will also givequantitative and qualitative feedback for the assignments that are due throughout the entire semester. You willalso be given feedback on your participation during the middle of the semester after the break.

The peer evaluation from the proposal assignment (to be released during mid-semester) alsoprovide give you some indication how well you have been performing in your team and you can improve on yourteamwork the rest of the semester.



F) Learning and Teaching approachApproachHow does this approach support you in achieving the learning outcomes?LecturesAs indicated in the course schedule, each lecture covers one or more topics. The topicswill also be discussed during the weekly tutorial sessions. Given the short lecture length,it will not be possible for every aspect of the topics to be covered during the lectures.Hence, the focus of the lectures is the clarification and explanation of the fundamentalmarketing frameworks and concepts.To facilitate your own learning, you should read the relevant materials before eachlecture. The required textbook (Principles of Marketing, An Asian Perspective) has astrong global orientation that can help broaden your understanding of marketing inpractice worldwide. References to the required textbook are provided in the courseschedule and the specific lecture slides. Recent articles and videos from various resources





are also included as references. These references are provided to encourage you toexplore beyond the textbook about the different marketing topics.Dr. Lim will conduct the lecture live online on Wednesday for all the students in thecourse. The video will be recorded each week and posted on the main AB1501 NTULearnpage. A telegram channel is available for you to post questions and queries about thetopics being covered each week during the lecture. You have a choice of attending thelive lecture sessions for you to have immediate engagement and asking questions and/orwatch the recorded videos and ask questions asynchronously. As the lecture will be onlyan hour long, there will be supplementary videos for different topics to cover someaspects in greater detail to deepen your understanding of the topics.Tutorial Sessions andGraded AssignmentsThe students will break up into different tutorial class group sessions (2 hrs each) eachweek (starting Week 02). Your respective tutor will facilitate the session. The tasks foreach tutorial session and graded projected are designed to help you to apply marketingframeworks and concepts to resolve marketing-related concerns. Given that there is nosingle solution to any of the tasks given, each task is a platform. to encourage discussionabout the different possibilities and perspectives. Through the class discussion with yourpeers and respective tutor, you will be able to learn through a cooperative learningprocess and share your own knowledge with others. If everyone is well prepared for thetasks, it will help facilitate the class discussion. Therefore, you are expected to preparefor the task(s) before each tutorial session. This cooperative learning approach can alsohelp develop your communication skills.For the graded assignments, all submissions are to be done online (i.e., to be uploadedto NTULearn). Therefore, the requirements of the assignments will not need to changein the event of increased social distancing restrictions and you can plan accordinglywithout expecting major changes. Your respective tutors will brief you further on theassignments in the first tutorial class session. Your team will have ½ hr each tutorialsession to work directly with the tutors on the marketing project.ExperimentsMarketing research is an integral part of the entire marketing process. Properly designedresearch can help marketers make better marketing decisions and further theunderstanding of the marketing environment. A substantial amount of such research isdone at universities. Hence, this course aims to expose you to such academic researchby providing you with the opportunity to take part in marketing-related experiments.Professors and/or post-graduate students from Nanyang Business School conduct theseexperiments. As part of your continuous assessment, you can choose to attend theexperiments that are allocated to you over the duration of the semester. If you do notwish to attend the experiments for any reason, you can choose to write a short critiqueon a research-related article as an alternative.
